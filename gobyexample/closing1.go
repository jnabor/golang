// _Closing_ a channel indicates that no more values
// will be sent on it. This can be useful to communicate
// completion to the channel's receivers.

// `range` provide iteration over basic data structures.
// We can also use this syntax to iterate over
// values received from a channel.

// to a worker goroutine. When we have no more jobs for
// the worker we'll `close` the `jobs` channel.

	done := make(chan bool)

	// Here's the worker goroutine. It repeatedly receives
	// from `jobs` with `j, more := <-jobs`. In this
	// special 2-value form of receive, the `more` value
	// will be `false` if `jobs` has been `close`d and all
	// values in the channel have already been received.

	// all our jobs.
